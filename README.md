PYTHON-KATAS
=============

This project contains some sample solutions for code katas in the Python programming language.
I do these katas regularly to improve my way of writing code by doing test driven development, changing only one piece at a time (baby steps) or doing interface discovery.

If you haven't heard of code katas yet, you may find this page usefull:

#The Katas

## [Grep](https://github.com/halimath/python-katas/blob/master/src/grep.py)
Very, very simple starter kata to learn tdd by grepping a string.

## [Add Numbers](https://github.com/halimath/python-katas/blob/master/src/addnumbers.py)
A really simple, algorithmic kata to learn tdd and baby steps. The problem is to evaluate a simple arithmetic expression given as a string.

## [Bowling](https://github.com/halimath/python-katas/blob/master/src/bowling.py)
Some kind of more advanced kata: Implement a system that keeps track of the score of a bowling game.

## [Tennis](https://github.com/halimath/python-katas/blob/master/src/tennis.py)
Same as bowling, this time using a tennis match.

## [Alien Language](https://github.com/halimath/python-katas/blob/master/src/alien_language.py)
Inspired by the Google Code Jam exercise found at [http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/90101/dashboard](http://code.google.com/codejam/contest/90101/dashboard)
