PYTHON-KATAS
=============

This project contains some sample solutions for code katas in the Python programming language.
I do these katas regularly to improve my way of writing code by doing test driven development, changing only one piece at a time (baby steps) or doing interface discovery.

If you haven't heard of code katas yet, you may find this page usefull:

#The Katas

## Grep
Very, very simple starter kata to learn tdd by grepping a string.

##Add Numbers
A really simple, algorithmic kata to learn tdd and baby steps. The problem is to evaluate a simple arithmetic expression given as a string.

## Bowling
Some kind of more advanced kata: Implement a system that keeps track of the score of a bowling game.

## Tennis
Same as bowling, this time using a tennis match.

## Alien Language
