Python Katas
============

# [Grep](https://github.com/halimath/katas/blob/master/python/src/grep.py)
Very, very simple starter kata to learn tdd by grepping a string.

# [Add Numbers](https://github.com/halimath/katas/blob/master/python/src/addnumbers.py)
A really simple, algorithmic kata to learn tdd and baby steps. The problem is to evaluate a simple arithmetic expression given as a string.

# [Bowling](https://github.com/halimath/katas/blob/master/python/src/bowling.py)
Some kind of more advanced kata: Implement a system that keeps track of the score of a bowling game.

# [Tennis](https://github.com/halimath/katas/blob/master/python/src/tennis.py)
Same as bowling, this time using a tennis match.

# [Alien Language](https://github.com/halimath/katas/blob/master/python/src/alien_language.py)
